task 1:
represent all numbers as vectors
see them in hyperdimensional space
maximum distance is radius
check if sets overlap
the larger the difference the better classification

task 2:
perceptron: accuracy on training set should be 100% because it's linearly separable

speed-up functions in python: 
pos max. value in vector (argmax), 
how to calculate all possible distances (at once?)

task 4:

check NN4 slide 44
257 x 10 matrix, (256 + 1)

general:
don't need to explain concepts
leaving out everything other students should know about is ok
